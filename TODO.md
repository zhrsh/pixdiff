- Add optional arguments (argparse?)
    - `--alpha <int alpha>` to control the opacity/alpha value of the diff mask. default is 128.
    - `--mask` to only save the "diff mask" with no original image under it, useful for further editing in an image/art software
    - `--no_save` don't save the diff image
    - `--path "<string path>"` to specify the diff result name or path. the default is `<image1>` + `_diff` + `<file_extension>` in the current working directory
    - `--pos` to return the coordinates/positions changed and print to screen.
    
- Make diff mask color coded according to type of change
    - `green_color = (0, 255, 0, 128)` for added pixels (from (x, x, x, 0) to (x, x, x, n), with n=1–255)
    - `red_color = (255, 0, 0, 128)` for deleted pixels (from (x, x, x, n) to (x, x, x, 0), with n=1–255)
    - `yellow_color = (255, 230, 0, 128)` for modified pixels (everything else)
